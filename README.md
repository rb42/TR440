# TR440
Emulator for the great german mainframe TR440 (Telefunken Rechner 440) - in use about 1970 to 1986.

The german website for the emulator with download is www.tr440.info including documentation.

To create the Windows program TR440.EXE, you can use the ADW-Modula-2-IDE in the 32-bit ASCII version. 
The IDE is available here for free download : https://www.modula2.org/adwm2/

Start the ASCII\m2e.exe, Select project <<None>> , open the project file TR440.sbp and press'Link'.
Everything else runs automatically.

Unfortunately, the size of the generated program differs slightly from the download version on www.tr440.info 
because it was generated by another compiler that is not freely available but can optimize even better.
